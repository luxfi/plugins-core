### plugins-core

`plugins-core` is plugin repository that ships with the [LPM](https://github.com/luxdefi/lpm). A plugin repository consists of a set of virtual machine and subnet definitions that the `LPM` consumes to allow users to quickly and easily download and manage VM binaries.

To build your own plugin repository, you can clone this repository and make your own `*.yaml` definition files under the `vms/` and `subnets/` directories.

### Contributing

This repository is meant to be driven by the community! If you have a virtual machine or a subnet you'd like to make available here, please submit a pull request or open a github issue.
